About Fathoms

The goal of Fathoms is simple. We're making information about California's public schools easy to find and easy to understand.

Fathoms gathers public information about California's public schools, and makes it easily available in one place.

How it came to be

It started sometime in 2011 as a pitch for a magazine article. I was living in Tampa, Florida and scrapping by as a freelance writer. My idea was to round up some data on the local schools and just see if anything looked interesting. A lifelong nerd and mathlete, I've always enjoyed working with and finding stories in numbers.

(Something about Brianne in a high school that was not challenging her.)

And at the time I was pretty interested in advanced sports analytics, and had even garnered a bit of attention for some of my work showing that a metric like SRS, which , had shown to be a surprisingly accurate predictor of upsets in the NHL playoffs.

And so, who knows, there's probably a story somewhere in this testing data. Maybe schools were offering what they'd call "AP classes," but at the end of the year none of the kids passed the AP exam. Maybe state standarized testing scores trended up as SAT and ACT scores remained flat.

But what I found was information scattered across the states Department of Education site. Any parent looking to get just the basics of about their kids school had to download a mess of csv, excel, and text files. A headache even for those who know their way around a database.

And since I was already fooling around with designing and building websites, it seemed like a nice little side project to throw myself into. I'd compile all the information, put it into a basic database, and build a profile page for each school in Hillsborough and Pinellas county.

After a few weeks I had managed to throw something together, and I was pretty happy with it. It was orginally called "Maple Lane," after my own elementary school in Claymont, Delaware, but both maplelane.com and maplelane.org were already taken by a X and Y.

So I spent way too much time brainstorming, and eventually landed on "Fathoms." Partially because is both a verb for understanding something and a unit of measurement, which seemed vaguely relavant, but mostly because I could procur the Fathoms.org domain for $9 a year.

And so like that I bought the domain, hosted the project on GitHub, and Fathoms.org was live. And then ... well, nothing happened. I mean, it pulled in a bit of traffic, but mostly it just sat there unused.

By this time I had accepted a job working for an ecommerce company in Tampa, I was beginning to
